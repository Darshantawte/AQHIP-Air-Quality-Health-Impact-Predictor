# AQHIP (Air-Quality-Health-Impact-Predictor)

1. Multiclass ML based project which based on features like PM2.5,PM10,SO2,Temperature,Humidity and other pollutants concentration in the environment predicts HealthImpactScore class from (0 - Very High to 4 - Very Low)

2. Performed Exploratory Data Anaylsis using libraries like Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn to extract significant details and insights from the data

3. Performed various Data Preprocessing techniques like Scaling, Impuation etc to make it ready for modelling

4. Used Modular coding to test/pass the data through multiple Multiclass ML models like SVC,KNNClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,XGBClassifier etc

5. Performed detailed Hyperparameter tunning for each of the ML algorithm above to find optimal parameter values and generalized model for the data.
